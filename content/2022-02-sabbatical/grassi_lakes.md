On an overcast and snowy afternoon Mom and I decided to hike up to Grassi Lakes. The tailhead is 'behind' the town of Canmore, and it is a short drive up the Three Sisters Parkway. The paths were packed snow and the hike doesn't involve terribly steep sections, so no snowshoes nor crampons were necessary. We did have some icers on just to avoid slipping on any icy sections. While it wasn't a super clear day we still got some nice views.

In the summer, the craigs around Grassi Lakes are a popular rock climbing area close to Canmore, but in the winter its quiet.
