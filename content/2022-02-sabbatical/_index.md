In early 2022, I took a brief hiatus from work to spend some time with my parents in the Canadian Rockies. My employer, TextNow, had an anniversary program that granted employees a one month, paid sabbatical after reaching 5 years of employment. In December of 2021 I reached my 5 year anniversary with the company, and with a variety of COVID-related travel restrictions still in place I decided to take the opportunity to spend my sabbatical doing something I loved as a kid - skiing. I stayed with my parents, who had moved to Canmore during the pandemic, which made it easy to get to the slopes. I was able to get 12 days of skiing in over the 23 days I was in Canmore, along with enjoying several other days outdoors in the mountains hiking. All in all it was a very relaxing break and to be able to spend it in the mountains was exactly what I needed.

Unlike most of my trips, this one is structured not by day, but instead by activity and location. I made many trips to the Lake Louise and Banff Sunshine ski resorts, and visited Banff National Park multiple times, so this structure will focus on the activity and less on the specific day it occurred.
