My employer, TextNow, has an anniversary program that grants its employees a one month, paid sabbatical after 5 years of employment. In December of 2021 I reached my 5 year anniversary, and with a variety of COVID-related travel restrictions still in place I decided to take the opportunity to spend my sabbatical doing something I loved as a kid - skiing. I stayed with my parents, who had moved to Canmore during the pandemic, and was able to get a lot of skiing in. In total I skied 12 days of the 23 I was in Canmore, and got to enjoy several other days outdoors in the mountains hiking. All in all it was a very relaxing break and to be able to spend it in the rockies was exactly what I needed.

Unlike most of my trips, this one is structured not by day but by location. I made many trips to the ski resorts, and visited Banff National Park multiple times, so this structure will focus on the activity and less on the specific day it occurred.
