I visited Lake Louise several times on my sabbatical; once with Todd and another time with my parents. The lake is spectacular to see in any season; in the winter it freezes over and becomes a skating rink, walking trail, and ice sculpture canvas for the hotel located on its shore. The Canadian Pacific railway built this hotel as a destination for tourists in the early part of the 20th century; and it continues to draw visitors from around the world to this day.

On a clear day, the views are breathtaking.

I was lucky enough to be able to stay at the hotel for an evening with my Dad, who had a work event there. I had visited the Chateau many times growing up, however this was the first time I was lucky enough to be able to stay there. The history is evident in the hotel - it's a beautiful place to see. The rooms are a reflection of the era they were constructed in - they are not large, but they are thoughtfully laid out and tastefully appointed.

There was minimal light pollution out on the ice at night, which let me capture some great photos. The night was quite cold, so I didn't get too many photos before my batteries and my fingers decided it was time to head back in.

On another visit to Lake Louise, Todd and I hiked up to Mirror Lake. It was a cloudy and snowy day, so the views weren't amazing, but it was enjoyable regardless!
