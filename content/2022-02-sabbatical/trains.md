The Canadian Pacific mainline runs through Banff National Park, and there are many opportunities to see freight trains going both east and westbound. The below are a collection of train photos I was able to capture on the trip at a variety of different locations.

## Morant's Curve

This might be one of the most iconic places for taking train photos in Canada. In the years after the second World War, the Canadian Pacific employed a photographer named Nicholas Morant who generated much of the photographic material used by the Canadian Pacific marketing department to popularize the country with tourists. His favourite place to take photos of trains was a curve along the Bow River, east of Lake Louise, and this spot is now known as Morant's Curve in recognition of his work. I only visited Morant's Curve once, but was very lucky that an eastbound train decided to appear during the brief period of time I was there.
