I spent the month living with my parents in a condo located right off of Main Street in Canmore. This was the perfect place to stay for a ski trip in the Rockies - it is close enough to both [Sunshine]({{< relref "banff_sunshine_village_skiing.md" >}}) and [Lake Louise]({{< relref "lake_louise_skiing.md" >}}) that I could choose where I skied based on the conditions of each hill. The condo was right off Main Street, and was just a short walk to [Elevation Place](https://www.canmore.ca/your-community/recreation/indoor-recreation), to the trails along the Bow River, and to many of the coffee shops and restaurants in town. I got a month pass to Elevation Place, which gave me unlimited access to the climbing wall and the pool at the recreation complex; and I made good use of the pass! I went climbing a half dozen times, and went swimming at a similar cadence. It was a good way to stay active on the days I wasn't skiing!

It's common to encounter elk while out in the town. On one walk we had to carefully pass by a herd of them grazing on a trail near the river - thankfully it wasn't rutting season so they weren't too fussed as we passed by.

The town of Canmore used to be the site of a couple of underground coal mines, and they were linked to the outside world by way of a rail spur off the Canadian Pacific mainline. This spur crossed the Bow river on an elaborate bridge, which has been preserved. It is now a pedestrian bridge which sees a lot of use. Fun fact - this bridge shows up in Season 1 of 'The Last of Us' when Joel and Elle are making their way to Wyoming.
