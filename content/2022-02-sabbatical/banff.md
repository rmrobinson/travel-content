A classic walk in the town of Banff takes you along the Bow River, to Bow Falls. I did this walk several times while in Banff; and the ice formations you can see on the river are pretty impressive.

The Banff Springs Hotel was constructed by the Canadian Pacific Railway to serve as a tourist destination the Canadian Rockies early in the 20th century. It is an impressive structure to see, and you get a great view of it among the trees on the trail.

There are still many parks and forests in the park - and you can find interesting-looking trees along the river.
