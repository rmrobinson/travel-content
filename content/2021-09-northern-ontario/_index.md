After a long year and a half of COVID-19 restrictions, I was looking forward to any sort of travel. When my good friend Patrick suggested we take a short road trip around Northern Ontario, I jumped at the opportunity. We rented a Tesla Model 3 and got driving, visiting a number of destinations along the way. The support for electric vehicles in Ontario was better than expected, and we managed to make our way through over 2,100 km of Ontario without encountering any charging issues.
