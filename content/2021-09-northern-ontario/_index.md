After a long year and a half of COVID-19 restrictions, I was looking forward to getting back to travelling. When my good friend Patrick asked if I was interested in joining him on a short road trip around Northern Ontario, I jumped at the opportunity. Unlike many other trips I had taken, this was a very spur of the moment vacation - Patrick first proposed the trip on August 26th, 2021 and we ended up departing on September 1st, 2021. We rented a Tesla Model 3 using the [Turo](https://turo.com/ca/en) car sharing platform, which made it super easy to get driving. We made few plans and did not book hotels before departing - the only thing that was fixed in the plan was a visit to Cochrane, ON in order to see polar bears. We ended up visiting a number of places during the 4 day trip, and we got to experience some very beautiful scenery. The timing of the trip was a bit too early for many of the trees to have changed to their fall colours, but that didn't take away from the beauty of the landscape. This was the first road trip that I'd taken in an electric car, and the availability of charging locations didn't end up causing any issues (though it wsa someting that we discussed a fair bit while on the road!). We made our way across 2,100 km of Ontario roads without running out of electricity, though we did make some routing decisions based on the availability of chargers.

Overall I would highly recommend a visit to Northern Ontario!
