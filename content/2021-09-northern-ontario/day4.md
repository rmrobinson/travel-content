The fourth day of the trip, like the previous days, started at 07:00. We got ready, packed up and had a quick breakfast at the hotel, before getting into the car and being on the road at 08:00. Patrick was the behind the wheel as we left Petawawa and began the drive along Highway 26 to Highway 58 on the way towards Algonquin Park.

The drive was uneventful, but there were definitely stretches where it was incredibly foggy.

Traffic was light as we pulled past the park gate and into the park. Our first stop was at the Algonquin Logging Museum, where we stretched our legs, saw some old logging structures, and then continued on,

After a short drive we pulled off at a viewpoint for Brewer Lake where we were treated to some spectacular views.

We continued on to the Visitor Centre, where we took a quick look at the park and got a great shot looking out into the park behind the centre.

We continued to the first hike of the day, Booth's Rock. We had a long drive down an unpaved road to reach the Rock Lake campground, and were lucky to find a free parking spot in the parking lot just past the camping area. The Booth's Rock hike was a 5.1 km loop that took us past a few small lakes and up a hill; the top of the hill was a cliff-side lookout over Whitefish Lake. After the lookout was a long staircase that took us down to an old rail line that served a dock on a small peninsula in the lake; the old rail line formed the base of the return trail along the side of the lake.

After completing the Booth's Rock hike, we headed back up the access road towards the highway. We pulled straight across into the parking lot for our second hike, the Big Pines trail. This second trail was described as visiting an old logging camp, and would be a roughly 3 km loop. It was lunchtime, so before setting off we made ourselves sandwiches with the supplies from the Shoppers the previous evening and had a quick lunch standing around the trunk of the car. It was quite hot out, and there was no protection from the sun in the parking lot, so we ate quickly, reapplied sunscreen and started out on the hike. This hike had less elevation gain than Booth's Rock, but it took us along some fairly rugged trails.

It didn't take us much more than an hour to complete the Big Pines trail - unfortunately we never got a good look at the logging camp that was supposed to be along the trail but it was still an enjoyable walk. We got into the car and began driving west through the park. We drove for about 20 minutes before reaching our next outing location - Peck Lake. There was a short 2 km loop that would take us around the lake, so after finding one of the last parking spots in the lot we set out on the walk.

After finishing the loop around Peck Lake we got into the car and continued on to the last hike we planned on doing in the park - a visit to the Hardwood Lookout trail. This trail was only marked as being 1 km in length, but as we began our walk we received a tip from another group coming down that it wasn't worth doing the whole thing, and it was better to go right to the lookout, so we skipped part of this trail. The lookout itself was fine.

{{< figure title="View from the Hardwood Lookout" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rmrobins-website-photos/2021-09-northern-ontario/DSC_1171.jpg" >}}

After coming back from the lookout we got back into the car. We had one quick stop at the visitor centre near the west gate to visit the washroom, then we drove out of the park towards Huntsville.

The charge level of the car was getting low as we pulled into the Huntsville Supercharger. Luckily there was an available spot when we pulled up, so we got to charging right away. We were planning on making the drive back to Kitchener that evening, so we needed to reach a pretty high level of charge
