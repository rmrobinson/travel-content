Finally, a bit of calm. The excitement of the last few days is over, and we had a bit less of an exiting day today. We spent the morning relaxing in the hotel and having a quick swim before packing up and taking a cab to Don Mueang for our flight down to Phuket. I think we've learned our lesson; we decided against taking another train! We will be spending the next few days at Patong Beach in the Phuket province in Thailand. The flight from DMK to HKT was uneventful, and we made it to our hotel with no issues. The drive from the airport to Patong Beach was longer than I expected; it took us over an hour.
