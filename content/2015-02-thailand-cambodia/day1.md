Today, really a day and a half, was spent entirely on airplanes. Todd and I awoke early, at approximately 3:00 AM ET, quickly getting showered and dressed before getting into my car and making the drive to Pearson. The traffic was light, though it was cold and slightly snowy. We parked at the Park 'N Fly Valet lot, then took the shuttle to Terminal 1. We checked in, checked our bags, cleared security and then went up to the Air Canada lounge to relax prior to the first flight. I believe that we were the first couple of people in the lounge, as it had just opened, which was kind of a neat experience.

The first flight, from Pearson to Newark, was uneventful. The flight from Newark to Narita was also quite uneventful. We flew on a United 777 named the Norman M Bethune. Todd handled the flight surprisingly well; even though he didn't get much sleep he seemed to be pretty perky by the time we landed. We had about 3 hours to kill at Narita so we visited the ANA lounge, and it had one of the best airport lounge views I've seen! You could see the gates clearly, as well as see the planes taxiing along the runway. I've never seen so many 777's and 787's before - the ANA fleet is pretty cool. The food was alright, but neither Todd nor I had the stomach to try the sushi.

Our ANA flight to BKK was unfortunately delayed by about 30 minutes, which doesn't sound like a lot but when you've been on the go for about a day it seems longer than you'd expect. By this point I was pretty tired, so I spent the majority of the flight sleeping. I did squeeze in most of 'The Matrix', however. This flight crossed the 30th hour of travel, which wreaked some havoc on my emotions - there were parts of the Matrix which caused me to cry! I chalked it up to the sleep deprivation, since it is not an emotional movie in the slightest.

The flight landed uneventfully, late at night in Bangkok. We cleared customs without issue, picked up our suitcases and found ourselves a cab. The drive took about 30 minutes, and upon arriving at the hotel we checked in without issue. Sleep was the only thing on our minds, so after brushing our teeth we quickly fell right to sleep.
