Our first full day in Phuket! I know how much Todd likes his beach days, so I set aside a full day to do nothing but relax and enjoy the sand and the surf of the gorgeous Patong beachfront upon our arrival. The location did not disappoint - the water was the perfect mix of refreshingly cool while also being pleasantly warm; and the sand was perfectly smooth without a rock to worry about. In many ways it reminds me of a nicer Jamaica or Cuba; full of tourists enjoying some sun and sand.

We seem to have gotten off lucky, with no sunburns to speak of - this is almost unheard of for me, but I have been pretty diligent with the sunscreen so things seem to be working out.
