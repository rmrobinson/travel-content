My trip to the arctic began early in the morning when I woke up in the [Four Points by Sheraton](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yyzpa-four-points-toronto-airport/) just outside Pearson airport. One of my travelling companions, Patrick, and I had shared a hotel room to avoid a very early morning drive up from Kitchener. We had an early day - our first flight (WS653) was scheduled to depart YYZ at 6:45 and was scheduled to land in Calgary at 9:00 local. Our second flight was scheduled to depart just one hour later, at 10:00 local, and land in Whitehorse about 2.5 hours later. We woke up early; my alarm went off at 4:45, and after quickly getting ready we walked out the front door of the hotel at 5:15. It was a short, 5 minute walk to Terminal 3. We had both checked in the day before and were only bringing carry on bags, which allowed us to go immediately to the security line. It was a good thing that we left early, as the security line was quite slow, luckily there were no complications and we were able to clear security around 5:50. We walked to the Terminal 3 food court, where we both ordered breakfast sandwiches from the Smash burger chain. We ate them quickly and reached our departure gate just as priority boarding was starting. The plane was full but there was enough room for our carry-on suitcases in the overhead bins. We were seated in Row 4, in seats D and E, which we hoped would help us as we had a tight connection and this would save time during deplaning.

The flight took off a few minutes behind schedule. Once in the air things were pretty uneventful - Patrick and I had a great conversation that lasted the duration of the flight. Our plane landed a few minutes behind schedule at Gate 72, which was on the far side of the new International terminal in Calgary. Our connecting flight was scheduled to depart from Gate A21, which was on the opposite side of the airport, and so once we were off the plane we moved quickly to reach our connection. The plane was at the gate when we reached it, several minutes before boarding was scheduled to start. We were both hungry, and the gate was right beside a small food court, so we decided to pick up something for lunch. We both ordered burgers from A&W and ate them before we got into line. Once on the plane we found out that we were seated beside the same lady we sat next to on our flight from Toronto; she lived in Dawson City and was travelling home. We had a nice chat with her about things to do in the Yukon as we waited for our second flight to take off.

Once we were airborne we finished up the conversation with our seatmate, Theresa, and then I put in my headphones and watched Spiderman: Homecoming on my phone. It was a pretty solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - much better than the previous Spiderman series in my opinion. The run time of the film and the length of the flight were almost identical, and so the final battle scene was starting just as we began to descend into Whitehorse. The approach brought us pretty close to some mountains, and we had a great view of them out the starboard side of the aircraft. We landed slightly ahead of schedule to clear and sunny skies in Whitehorse.

We deplaned via an airstair onto the tarmac of the Erik Nielsen International Airport shortly after 12:30, and then walked into the terminal. Both Patrick and I had brought our suitcases carry-on, however our other travelling companions (Dan and Thyra) had checked bags, so we waited for a few minutes in the baggage claim area. The bags appeared quite quickly, and after Dan retrieved them we walked out of the terminal a beautiful and sunny day. The plan was to meet Thyra's brother, Jeremy, in the airport parking lot, and then he was going to give us a lift to our rental car pickup. We waited outside, taking in the fresh air and the views around the airport. Jeremy pulled up to the parking lot several minutes after stepped outside in a big pickup truck, and after introductions we loaded up the truck and headed into Whitehorse.

Instead of taking us right to the rental car agency, Jeremy offered instead to give us a driving tour of Whitehorse. We happily took him up on the offer! The city wasn't terribly large so the tour didn't take very long; he pointed out the highlights such as the good restaurants, the SS Klondike and Main Street. After checking out the Whitehorse downtown area he drove us to his house, where Patrick and I met his wife and their newborn son. Dan and Thyra got to catch up with family while Patrick and I relaxed for a bit. After about 30 minutes we got back into the truck and drove to the rental car company, [Driving Force](https://www.drivingforce.ca/en/). The Driving Force office was on the outskirts of the city, right near the airport, and we drove back through downtown Whitehorse on the way. We were scheduled to pick up our vehicle at 14:00, and when we arrived at 13:30 the vehicle was still being cleaned. We signed all the paperwork then headed back into town for lunch while the finishing touches were being put on the car. We drove past a few different restaurants that Jeremy recommended, unfortunately they were all closed for some unknown reason. We ended up eating at [The Deck](https://www.coasthotels.com/hotels/yukon/whitehorse/coast-high-country-inn/dining/), a restaurant next to the Coast High Country Inn. We had a nice lunch here on the patio, where we got to enjoy a sunny Whitehorse afternoon. I had a bison burger with fries that was pretty tasty. After a relaxing lunch we drove back and picked up the vehicle, a Yukon XL, at around 15:00.

Once we had the car we split into two groups. Dan and Thyra went back with Jeremy to spend more time with their new nephew, while Patrick and I went to the SS Klondike National Historic Site. The SS Klondike is a restored paddle wheel steamer that used to ferry people and supplies between Whitehorse and Dawson City on the Yukon river. It was a free museum to visit; we were allowed to walk through the inside of the ship, which was restored to look like it was ready to head up river over 100 years earlier. It was a fun place to visit, but we didn't stay very long as there wasn't a lot to see once we'd done a circuit of the ship.

We left the Klondike and went to our hotel. We had a room booked at the [Town and Mountain Hotel](http://townmountain.com/), which was right in downtown Whitehorse. Checking in was easy, and we brought our bags up to the hotel room. This was the first hotel I'd been to in a while that issued an actual key to the room, which was a bit of a fun throwback. We took a short break in the hotel room as we unpacked a couple things, then headed back down to the car.

Our next stop was the Whitehorse Walmart, to pick up some supplies for the upcoming drive. We stocked up on water, snacks and some basic supplies. We expected that things were going to get more expensive as we drove north, so we wanted to pick up as much as we could in Whitehorse. We left the store with many bags of chips, a variety of gummy candies, cookies, bagels, bread, coffee and other non-perishables. We also picked up extra bug spray, sunscreen and a lighter for the camping stove Jeremy lent us. The shopping trip took about an hour, bringing us to 16:45. We had a bit of time until dinner - we were joining Dan and Thyra for dinner with Jeremy and his family at 18:00. We spent the next hour taking a walk along the Yukon river, looking at the scenery and stretching our legs. The views along the river were spectacular, and it was a nice time to have a bit of a breather as we had been on the go since early that morning.

We got back into the car at 17:45 and drove to Jeremy's house for dinner. It was really thoughtful of them to have us over, and we had a nice conversation over charcuterie and pizza. It was a relaxed meal; a homemade pizza would be put on the BBQ just as the previous one had finished cooking, and then we'd eat the pizza that had just come out. We were all feeling tired after the early morning, so by about 20:00 Patrick and I called it an evening and drove back to the hotel. It didn't take long to get ready for bed, and I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.
