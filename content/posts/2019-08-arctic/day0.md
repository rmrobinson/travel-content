The trip to the arctic began early today, with a wakeup in the 4 Points by Sheraton just outside Pearson airport. We had an early day of flying - our itinerary had us departing from YYZ at 6:45 on WS653, scheduled to land in Calgary at 9:00 local. Our second flight was scheduled to depart just one hour later, at 10:00, and land in Whitehorse about 2.5 hours later. In order to ensure we made our first flight we woke up early; my alarm went off at 4:45, and after quickly getting ready we were walking out the front door of the 4 Points by Sheraton at 5:15. It was a short, 5 minute walk from the hotel to Terminal 3, where we got in line for security. It was a good thing that we left early, as the security line was quite slow, however there were no complications and we were walking towards the Terminal 3 food court around 5:50. We grabbed a breakfast sandwich from the Smash burger chain, ate it quickly and reached our departure gate just as the priority boarding was starting. The plane was full but there was enough room for our carry-on suitcases in the overhead bins. We were seated in Row 4, in seats D and E, which we hoped would help us as we had a tight connection and this would save time during deplaning.

We took off a few minutes behind schedule. The flight was pretty uneventful - Patrick and I spent most of the time chatting about a number of different topics but it was a great conversation. Our plane landed a few minutes behind schedule at Gate 72, which was on the far side of the new International terminal in Calgary. Our connecting flight was departing from Gate A21, which is basically on the opposite side of the airport, and so once we were off the plane we quickly hustled to reach our connection. The plane was at the gate when we reached it, several minutes before boarding was scheduled to start. We were both hungry, and the gate was right beside a small food court, so we quickly grabbed and ate a burger from A&W before we got into line. We were actually seated beside the same lady as we were on the flight to Calgary; she lives in Dawson City and we had a nice chat with her about things to do as we were waiting for our second flight to take off.

Once we were airborn we finished up our conversation with our seatmate, Theresa, then I put in my headphones and watched Spiderman: Homecoming. It was a pretty solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - much better than the previous Spiderman series in my opinion. The runtime of the film and the length of the flight were almost identical, so the final battle scene was occurring as we were beginning to descend into Whitehorse. The approach brought us pretty close to some mountains, which we had a great view of out the starboard side of the aircraft. We landed slightly ahead of schedule to clear and sunny skies in Whitehorse.

We deplaned via an airstair onto the tarmac at the airport at shortly after 12:30, and then walked into the terminal. Both Patrick and I had carry-on suitcases, but Dan and Thyra had checked a bag so we had to wait a few minutes in the baggage claim area. The bags appeared pretty quickly, we gathered our things and walked out into the parking lot of the Erik Nielsen International Airport. We were meeting Thyra's brother, Jeremy, here, and he was going to give us a lift to our rental car pickup. We waited outside for several minutes, taking in the fresh air and the views around the airport, before Jeremy arrived. He brought a nice big pickup truck, and we quickly loaded it up before heading into town.

Jeremy started by giving us a driving tour of Whitehorse. The city wasn't super large so this tour didn't take too long, but he pointed out the highlights including some good restaurants, the SS Klondike and main street. After checking out the area we went to his house, where we met his wife and their newborn son. Dan and Thyra got to catch up with family while Patrick and I relaxed for a bit. After about 30 minutes we got back into the truck and drove to the rental car company, (Driving Force)[]. The office was on the outskirts of the city, so we drove back through downtown Whitehorse on the way. We were scheduled to pick up our vehicle at 14:00, so when we arrived at 13:30 the vehicle was still being cleaned. We signed all the paperwork then headed back into town for some lunch. We tried a few different restaurants that Jeremy recommended however for some reason they were all closed; we ended up eating at <TODO: where did we eat?>. We had a nice lunch here on the patio, enjoying the sunny Whitehorse afternoon. I had a bison burger with fries that was pretty tasty. After a relaxing lunch we drove back and picked up the vehicle, a Yukon XL, at around 15:00.

At this point in the day we split into two groups. Dan and Thyra went back with Jeremy to spend more time with their new newphew, while Patrick and I went to the SS Klondike National Historic Site. This historic site is a restored paddlewheel steamer that used to bring people and supplies between Whitehorse and Dawson City on the Yukon river. It was free for us to get onboard, where we got to see the inside of the ship, restored to look like it was ready to head up river. It was a neat place to take some photos, but we didn't stay very long as there wasn't a lot to see once we'd done a circuit of the ship.

We left the ship and went to our hotel. We were booked in the [Town and Mountain Inn](), which was right in downtown Whitehorse. Checking in was easy, and we brought our bags up to the hotel room. This was the first hotel I'd been to in a while that issued an actual key to the room, which was a bit of a funny throwback. We took a short break in the hotel room as we unpacked a couple things, then headed back down to the car.

After leaving the hotel Patrick and I went to the Walmart in Whitehorse to pick up some supplies for the drive. We stocked up on water, snacks and some basic supplies. Things were only going to get more expensive the farther north we drove, so we wanted to pick up as much as we could in Whitehorse. We got a bunch of chips, some gummies, cookies, bagels, bread, coffee and other nonperishables, and also picked up some extra bug spray, sunscreen and a lighter for the camping stove Jeremy was lending us. Shopping took about an hour, bringing us to around 16:45. We weren't scheduled to arrive at Jeremy's for dinner until 18:00, so we took a walk along the Yukon river to kill some time and stretch our legs. The views along the river were spectacular, and it was a nice time to have a bit of a breather as we had been on the go since early that morning.

Around 17:45 we got back into the car and drove to Jeremy's house for dinner. He and his wife were making pizzas on their barbequeue, and we had a nice conversation over some charquterie and pizzas. It was a relaxed meal; a pizza would be put on the BBQ once the previous one finished cooking, and we'd eat the previous pizza while the current one was cooking. We were all feeling tired after the early morning, so by about 20:00 Patrick and I both called it an evening and drove back to the hotel. It didn't take long to get ready for bed, and I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.
