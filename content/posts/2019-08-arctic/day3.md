This was the day that we left paved roads behind and started up the Dempster Highway. The plan was to leave Dawson City early, leaving us with more than enough time to make it to the Eagle Plains lodge before evening. I had set my alarm for 7:00 the night before; and when it went off I got up, showered, packed, and headed down to the lobby at 7:50. The hotel staff had laid out warm croissants and cheese in front of every room early in the morning; I snacked on these while I drank a coffee in the lobby. Patrick, Dan and Thyra were only moments behind; we loaded up the car and checked out just after 8:00. We drove a block over to [Triple J's](http://triplejhotel.com/) for breakfast. This restaurant had been a recommendation of Jeremy's as a good place to eat, and we certainly enjoyed our meals there. I had a breakfast wrap with eggs, bacon, cheese and salsa - it also came with a generous serving of home fries, and it was very tasty. I wasn't able to finish the home fries as the portion was just too big. After breakfast we filled up the Yukon with gas and were our way to the Dempster highway shortly after 9:00.

The Dempster highway starts about 40 km south of Dawson City, at a turnoff from Highway 2. There is a small gas station at the intersection of the Dempster and Highway 2, but we had been warned that it might not be open so we made sure we had a full tank before leaving Dawson. The beginning of the highway has a sign with some information about the wildlife in the area - we stopped and took a quick look at the sign before starting the drive. As we started driving the Dempster Dan was behind the wheel. The first few kilometres of the Dempster were paved, however it quickly turned to gravel. There hadn't been a lot of rain in the past few days, so the gravel road was still well graded and there were only a few small potholes. Once Dan got the feel for the road we were able to cruise along at roughly 80 km/h. As the highway took us north towards Tombstone Territorial Park we were on the lookout for wildlife and enjoying the gorgeous scenery. There is a wide variety of wildlife that lives on the land surrounding the Dempster, and we were hoping to catch sight of some of these creatures on the drive. The road was not super busy as we went along, though there was some traffic.

The first stretch of the drive was pretty uneventful. Our first major stop was at the visitor centre in the Tombstone Territorial Park, which we arrived at shortly after 11:00. The visitor centre was in a building that was quite new and beautifully constructed. We got out of the car and took the opportunity to stretch our legs. I took some photos of the surrounding mountain range, and then we walked up to the visitor centre and spent about 15 minutes touring through the exhibits.

It was a beautfully sunny morning at this point, so Patrick and I decided to take a short walk in the park. We first moved the car from the visitor centre parking lot over to the Tombstone campground parking lot, a few hundred metres up the road. Once we were parked near the trailhead Patrick and I set off on a hike that followed the bank of a river up to a valley. As we walked we were treated to some spectacular views of the Tombstone mountain range, and as we hiked I got some great photos of the river valley, the river itself, and the mountains around us. The trail had an out-and-back style that was marked as having a round trip distance of 3.4 km, and we took just about an hour to go to the end and come back. There was some scrambling down to reach the riverbed at the turnaround point of the trail, but other than that it was a pretty easy route. There were some boardwalks towards the end which allowed us to keep our feet dry as trail took a detour through a small bog. We got back to the car around 12:30, then continued our drive towards Eagle Plains.

After leaving the Tombstone campground the highway climbs up the end of the river valley, and at the top there are some impressive views back towards the Tombstone mountain range. We stopped at the lookout here, grabbed a few photos, then continued driving. As we continued driving through the Tombstone Territorial Park we saw some pretty mountain passes, though many of the mountain peaks were a fair bit lower than what you might see in the Rockies. The road followed the <TODO: name> river for a fair bit of time, and as we continued we took some photos of the river and the peaks from the car.

We stopped for lunch after another hour and a bit of driving from the hike. We found a turnoff from the highway which led down to the river, and we drove down here to have our lunch. We setup a small camping stove and made ourselves coffee, then ate some cold cut sandwiches and snacks. The riverbed was quite a bit wider than the current river flow needed, so we got to do a bit of scrambling on the river rocks to get closer to the water. We took some photos, packed up the car, and continued on.

We left the Tombstone park and continued on. The road crossed several bridges. As we continued north we passed through the Taiga range, which was interesting in that its mountains felt as though they were in their last stages of existence. The mountains were hardly taller than hills, and mostly covered with gravel. The few trees that were growing were on the sheltered side of the mountain, and gravel was falling down the face. It felt like, in several thousand years, they wouldn't even be there anymore. The views were spectacular.

We left the Tagia mountain range, and climbed an escarpment to the Eagle Plains plateau. We stopped just at the top at a viewpoint, where we had a great view back towards the Ogilvie Mountain Range that we had just driven through. We continued along into a low tundra environment with very short, thin evergreen trees growing on either side of the road. It was interesting to see a long stretch that had clearly been burned in a forest fire several years ago; there were some small plants that had started growing back but many tree trunks were completely burned. We continued driving through this sort of environment until we arrived in Eagle Plains.

Eagle Plains is a small outpost located just over halfway between Dawson and Inuvik, and was constructed in 1978. The location was chosen as it has exposed bedrock, which gave them something to build on that did not require installing pilings through the permafrost. This outpost has a gas station, a 32 room hotel, a small restaurant and some camp sites, and is where we were going to spend the night. We arrived at 18:15, checked in, and got our stuff out of the car. We learned that the restaurant was only open until 20:00, so after unpacking and filling up the car with gas we went and had dinner. The food choices were pretty basic, as expected - diner food mostly. I had a beef dip sandwich with fries, which was actually pretty good. The food wasn't cheap but wasn't too expensive either - $17 for the meal. We had a couple beers and relaxed in the lounge afterwards, which was a nice way to unwind after a long day of driving.

After a bit of relaxing we grabbed our cameras and walked around the hotel, where there was a small lookout point constructed to give views of the terrain around us. It was quite pretty as the sun was getting low in the sky, but it was easily several hours until dark. We went back to the lounge and relaxed until we were all tired and headed to bed, around 21:00.
