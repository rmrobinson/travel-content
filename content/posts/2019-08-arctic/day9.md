This was our slack day in Dawson, so we weren't in a hurry to get going early. After staying up late at Gertie's we were all tired, and didn't get going until around 9:30. We didn't go far for breakfast - we chose the buffet at our hotel (though we did have to go across the road to reach the building with the restaurant). It was nice waking up without being worried about packing everything up. The buffet was pretty decent, all things considered.

After breakfast we decided to explore a bit, and walked back to the river pathway where a small arts and crafts show was set up. There were about a dozen people who had set up shop in a small open-air market building on the peninsula of land between the one paved road and the river, selling some small home-made arts. A few examples include paintings, stained glass window coverings, and pottery. As we were walking through we chatted briefly with one of the people who was telling us about the bears he had encountered while living in the Yukon. I decided to purchase a coffee mug from one of the vendors as a souvenir from the trip; it was quite pretty but I was a bit concerned whether I could safely transport it home. (Ed: it made it home safely). It was a sunny but cool morning in Dawson. After visiting the fair we briefly spoke with a Discovery Days organizer who let us know about several other activities happening today, including some live music in the park and the annual [Mud Bog](https://dawsoncity.ca/event/dawson-city-mud-bog/). We took a detour back to our hotel where we picked up our cameras, then head out for the morning.

We went back to the river, and stopped at the intersection of Princess St and the Klondike highway, where there was a small stage featuring a lone guitarist. He was performing some original content, singing and guitaring along. He performed several songs before the end of his set, and shortly afterwards he was replaced by a duo performing with a guitar and violin.



We had another early start to the day - we had set the alarm for 6:30 the evening before, and got up as scheduled. Patrick got ready ahead of me as I was still pretty tired from my night-time photo taking, but we were all packed up and having breakfast just after 7:00. We all ordered the same breakfast that we had on our first stop, and were done eating by 7:30. We packed up the car and got on the road around 7:45, and were the first people away from what we could see. The weather had gotten a fair bit colder than when I was taking my photos, and a thin layer of snow was coating the ground. We drove into the snow, hoping that the road conditions would be good. Dan had the first shift behind the wheel this morning, and said that while the roads were a bit slick it wasn't too bad.

We drove for a few hours through the winding roads, and around 10:30 decided to pull off near a river to have a snack and a coffee. We quickly boiled water for the coffee while small snowflakes drifted down from the sky - it was probably a couple degrees below zero but the ground was still soft and muddy. We had a quick coffee and then continued driving.

The roads were fine and we were making good time, so we stopped for lunch at 11:45 near the border of the Tombstone territorial park. We again made coffee, then had cold cut sandwiches and apples. It was a bit breezy so we ate quickly, and continued on after about 30 minutes.

As we drove into the Tombstone mountain range we could see that snow had started to accumulate on the tops of the mountain peaks, which madee the range seem larger than it had when we first drove out. It's funny how a bit of snow makes the mountains seem more real. We pulled off to the side of the road around 13:00 to get a few photos of the mountains from the car, then continued driving on.

We reached the lookout just past the Tombstone interpretive centre around 13:20, and got out of the car and took a few photos. The lighting was better than it had been on our first stop, and with the colours starting to change in the valley there were some pretty scenes to capture. We spent about 10 minutes here before continuing on. We didn't stop at the interpretive centre, but continued driving to the Grizzly Lake campground parking lot about 15 km past. The Grizzy Lake campground was a 23 km hike in from the parking lot, and we had learned about this on our first visit to the interpretive centre. We had made good time to this point, so Patrick and I decided to do an hour long hike along the trail. We grabbed the bear spray, a bottle of water, and begin walking around 13:45. We went a couple kilometres up the trail, seeing some pretty vistas and also watched a woodpecker hammering a tree. We turned around when we reached a river, making it back to the car just after 14:45.

After getting back in the car we drove without stopping to the end of the Dempster Highway, reaching the sign at 15:30. We had reset a trip odometer as we started the drive, and checked the distance when we reached the sign. We had driven 1882.7 km on gravel roads over the past 6 days, making it to Tuk and back without a flat tire or needing to be pulled out of the ditch! We were pretty happy, and got a group photo with the super dirty car. We were excited to get back onto pavement, and began driving back to Dawson.

We were only a few minutes into the drive to Dawson when we saw a couple cars pulled onto the side of the road, and as we slowed we noticed a grizzy on the passenger side of the vehicle, just off the shoulder. It was probably no more than 50' away. We had our cameras handy and managed to get a few photos before it got bored and went back into the trees just past the shoulder of the road. We completed the drive to Dawson without further animal encounters; we were pretty surprised we saw a grizzy so close to town. It took about 30 more minutes of driving.

As we were arriving in Dawson we didn't go right to the hotel, but instead took a detour up to the top of the Midnight Dome lookout. This lookout is near the top of the big hill beside the town, and driving to the top gave us a great view down to the town, as well as seeing the Klondike river feeding into the Yukon. There were a fair number of people up at the lookout, but we were able to get a few good photos anyways. We only needed to spend about 10 minutes here before we got back into the car and drove to the hotel. We arrived shortly before 17:00/.

We were staying in the [Westmark Hotel](), and while it was maybe a bit more corporate than our other accomodations we had stayed in the rooms were clean and comfy. We unpacked and decided to go searching for food. We were all craving that wasn't fried, and settled on pizza. We went to [Joe's Wood Fired Pizza](), and were lucky to grab the last table. I ordered a prosciutto and arugula pizza, and when it came I really enjoyed it. It was nice to have some fresh vegetables after so many days of unhealthy food. We spent about an hour and a half having dinner, and left the restaurant around 19:00.

We hadn't realized it when we booked the trip, but we had arrived in Dawson on the Saturday of a long weekend. The upcoming Monday was Discovery Day, a territorial holiday that many people treat as the last big weekend of the summer. There were a lot of people in town, many of them locals or people who lived somewhere in the Yukon but wanted to party in Dawson for the weekend. We had heard good things about [Diamond Tooth Gertie's](), Canada's oldest gambling hall, and decided to walk there. We had spoken with a number of locals over the course of our trip who had asked if we had visited Gertie's yet, and everyone had positive things to say about it. We each had to purchase our yearly pass to the gambling hall as we entered; for a $15 fee we would be able to visit the casino as many times as we liked. We entered into a fairly small casino that had some blackjack tables and slot machines near the front, with a large area in the middle set up with tables in front of a stage.

Playing some blackjack was only one of the reasons we chose to visit Gertie's - the other big reason was their three-times nightly can can show. The venue put on shows at 20:30, 22:00 and midnight that attempt to evoke the spirit of the venue as it would have been during 1800's gold rush. There was a pianist and drummer setup at one side of the stage playing rag-time music, a singer dressed up like Gertie (the original owner and namesake of the gambling hall), and four ladies dressed up like traditional can can dancers with the big fluffy skirts. We got a table shortly after entering, and had a drink while we waited for the first show to start. The musicians came on at 20:00 and played music for about 15 minutes, which was some nice background noise, and right on time the show started.

The performance went on for 30 minutes, and was able to showcase both the great singing voice of Gertie as well as the dancing skills of the can can dancers. It was actually a really high budget production - I was surprised at how good it was. There was one song, where Gertie was singing about how she liked bald men, that she came up to me and rubbed my head as she sang which was pretty amusing. Once the show was over both Dan and Thyra headed back to the hotel as they were tired; while Patrick went to play some blackjack and I watched. We stuck around and watched the 22:00 show, which was different in that it included a male singer and told a little bit of a story through song about the life of a miner who would have lived in the area. It included the song 'Mr. Cellophane' from Chicago that I enjoyed.

After the 22:00 show was over we decided to stay for the midnight show as well, so Patrick went back to the blackjack table and I watched. I wasn't really feeling like gambling that night, so I just people watched while he played. The last show was a bit less traditional, focusing more on somewhat modern rock style songs, but was still good. Once the show was over we went back to the hotel and passed out after a long day.
