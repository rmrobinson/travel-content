This was the first day on the road! We were leaving Whitehorse and driving to Dawson City, a roughly 500 km drive that Google estimated would take 6 hours (excluding stops). In order to give ourselves lots of time for the drive we woke up at 6:30. Patrick and I each had a quick shower, packed up and checked out at 7:00. We had planned on picking Dan and Thyra up at 7:30, so with a bit of time to spare we walked to the Starbucks for a coffee and breakfast sandwich. We were remarking that this is probably one of the northernmost Starbucks locations in the world; though we needed to confirm that when we got back (*edit: Whitehorse has the northernmost Starbucks in Canada, however Fairbanks is home to the northernmost Starbucks in the world*). While we were walking to breakfast we passed by the Whitehorse Pride intersection, which had both rainbow pride and trans pride crosswalks. This was an unexpected but welcomed bit of inclusiveness in the Arctic. After having a quick breakfast we headed to Jeremy's house, where we picked up Dan, Thyra and some camping supplies. The trunk was full by the time we had everything packed in but it hardly felt cramped in the vehicle as we waved goodbye to Jeremy.

We had a couple small stops to make before we could leave Whitehorse - first a grocery store, and then a gas station. We picked up some fresh fruits, cold cuts, cheeses and ice at the Save-on-Foods, and then filled up both the car and a jerry can with gas. Jeremy had been gracious enough to lend us a jerry can - there were only a handful of gas stations on the highway we would be driving and we wanted to have a backup in case we ran out of gas along the way. Shortly after 9:00 we pulled onto the Yukon Highway 2 and began the drive to Dawson City. I was starting off the day in the drivers seat, and driving was an easy task in the Yukon XL. We saw a deer on the side of the road shortly after leaving Whitehorse, which got us into the animal-spotting mode early in the trip.

The highway to Dawson was one lane in either direction, and well paved. The vehicle was equipped with Android Auto, which was convenient for us to see the driving directions and control the music playlist. It didn't take long before we were being treated to some spectacular views of some rolling hills and small mountains. We enjoyed the scenery for an hour or so before we reached our first stop, the Braeburn Lodge. It was right on the side of the highway, and had been recommended as a good place to get a cinnamon bun. The lodge was a bit of a one stop shop - it had gas, snacks, and a small diner-style restaurant. We picked up a cinnamon bun that was the size of a pie to share, and split it four ways and snacked on it on a picnic bench just outside the lodge. The cinnamon bun was fine - its size was probably its most notable aspect. We only stopped for 15 minutes or so before we got back into the car and continued on. Shortly after the Braeburn Lodge we reached our first photo lookout, as the road began winding down into a river valley. It was breathtakingly beautiful; after snapping a few photos we got back into the vehicle and continued on.

We passed a few small towns as we continued north, including Carmacks, Pelly Crossing and Stewart Crossing. The drive from Whitehorse to Dawson City was the longest distance we would cover in a single day, however it was the only drive that took place on paved roads so we made good time as we drove on. We stopped at a few other lookouts along the way, including a really impressive on above Pelly Crossing.

We stopped for lunch around 13:00, just outside Stewart Crossing. There was a rest area just to the side of the highway we pulled into - there were picnic tables and washrooms which made it an ideal place to take a break. We made sandwiches and coffee, and enjoyed a bit of time in the fresh air. We stopped here for about 45 minutes; once lunch was over we packed up and got back on the road. Shortly after lunch we started driving through some heavy rains, which was really the only bad weather we had on the drive this day.

We arrived in Dawson City shortly after 16:15, and drove to our hotel, named [Bombay Peggy's](http://bombaypeggys.com/). It used to be the Dawson City brothel, run by a matron named Peggy. It is now a boutique hotel, where the rooms are restored to look like they did at the turn of the last century. Patrick and I each had single rooms on the top floor (I was in a room named the Snug, while Patrick was in the Lookout room), while Dan and Thyra shared the Lipstick room on the second floor. We dropped our bags off at the hotel, then went and explored Dawson City.

Downtown Dawson felt very rustic - only Front Street at the edge of the city is paved, and there are boardwalks in front of the businesses to walk on. We started by walking to the river, where we saw a paddle-wheeler going upstream. We walked by a few businesses on Front Street, then we visited the Northwest Territories Visitor Centre where we picked up some information about Inuvik and Tuk. We then walked around the rest of downtown, taking photos of some of the old-time buildings and scoping things out. We went back to the hotel for a couple of drinks during the bar's happy hour, then walked to dinner at the [Drunken Goat Taverna](https://www.facebook.com/billygoatpub). This Greek restaurant had been recommended to us by Jeremy and Bonnie, and it was actually pretty tasty.

After dinner we went to the Downtown Hotel, a bar that is a staple of downtown Dawson. We sat down just after 20:00, and ordered a drink. They had live music - the performer was a decent guitar player but not a great singer. We came to this specific bar for a particular reason: to drink the Sourtoe cocktail. The Sourtoe is a bit of a local tradition: it is not a cocktail in the traditional sense, instead it is a shot of a hard liquor that is drunk after a mummified human toe is put in the shot glass. The ritual is administered by an elderly gentlemen who only goes by the nickname 'The Captain'; he had a reserved table at the back of the bar. Starting at 21:00 you can bring a shot to his table, where he will record your information, place the toe into the glass, and then you drink the shot. If the toe doesn't touch your lips then you haven't truly drunk the shot; it is also clearly explained that there is a fine for eating the toe (apparently this has happened on more than one occasion). Both Dan and I chose to drink the Sourtoe with a shot of Yukon Gold whisky, a sweet whisky popular in the area and the classic choice of liquor to pair with a toe. Neither Thyra nor Patrick decided to partake in this part of Dawson lore. We walked to the back of the bar a few minutes past 21:00, where we discovered that a line of people waiting to drink the Sourtoe. We hadn't expected it to be quite as popular as it seemed to be, but it was just a short wait until Dan was at the front of the line. He did the shot first, and had an issue where the toe got stuck in the glass and wouldn't touch his lips - he had to hit the glass several times to have it fall down and have it count. I went next; having learned from Dan's experience I quickly flung the glass back so the toe would fall to my lips the first time. After completing the shot we were each issued a numbered certificate of completion - I was the 90368th person to have done this particular activity.

After completing the Sourtoe cocktail we left the Downtown Hotel, and went back to our hotel where we had one final nightcap at the hotel bar. We headed to bed around 23:00, having had a busy day of driving and exploring Dawson!
