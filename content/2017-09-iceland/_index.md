One evening early in 2017 I was chatting with friends when the question 'where do you want to go next?' came up. As it turned out, a lot of us were interested in seeing Iceland, and that kicked off a plan which led to us planning a group trip later that year. Our plan was to drive around the island on Highway 1, and do as much hiking as we could along the way.

While the late September weather wasn't ideal, the rain didn't stop us from having a great time and seeing a lot of the country. We got some really unique stories out of it, too - it'll be a while before I forget how difficult it was to open the car doors on Dyrhólaey due to the high wind speeds, or how drenched we all were hiking up to Svartifoss. Not every day had rain - once we left the southern part of the island we had many dry and sunny days. We were lucky enough to see the northern lights on multiple occasions, and we thankfully had no troubles on the road.

I was very lucky to have taken this trip with my friends, and would strongly encourage people to check out the natural beauty of Iceland. Just be sure to bring waterproof clothing!
