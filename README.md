# Robert's Travel Blog

This repository contains the text content for my travel blog, available [here](https://travel.rmrobinson.ca). This content is rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and uses a custom theme for Hugo that I have built, named [Hugo Traveler](https://github.com/rmrobinson/hugo-traveler).

The images are hosted on S3, and the videos are hosted on Youtube.
